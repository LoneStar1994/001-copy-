 ##########################################SENDING INFORMATION

 #The function "Push" will take your query directly to the server
 #You need to fill it out like:

 # Client.push(pid, "name of your channel", "event", %{info1: "something1", info2: "something2"})

 #Since our server is programmed for filling a "fruits baskets list" it is specting something like this:

# Client.push(pid, "server:1", "<an event>", %{name: "something1", detail: "something2"})

# You can select some events to happen:

#"new" : it spects a name and a detail of a fruit, the name cannot be repeated so if by any chance
#         you type in a name of a fruit that already exists on a data base it will return an error
# Client.push(pid, "server:1", "new", %{name: "apple", detail: "tasty fruit"})


#"show_all" : It will display all the content inside the data base
# Client.push(pid, "server:1", "show_all", %{})

#"show" : it will display a selected "id" from our data base
# Client.push(pid, "server:1", "show", %{id: # of id})
#If it cannot get back a correct value it will return a warning telling you that something is wrong

#"edit" : It will let you do an edition on the details of a fruit that you request by it's id
# Client.push(pid, "server:1", "edit", %{id: # of id, detail: "the info you want to edit"})
#It will do the requested edition and if by anychance 

#"delete" : It will delete the information of a given ID inside the data base.
# Client.push(pid, "server:1", "delete", %{id: # of id})
#If it cannot delete it properly it will return a warning
